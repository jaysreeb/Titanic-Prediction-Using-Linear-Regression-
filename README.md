Submission Description:

I used a Logistic Regression model to predict survival outcomes in the Titanic dataset. The features were preprocessed by handling missing values, 
performing feature engineering (including the creation of 'FamilySize'), and encoding categorical variables. Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler. 
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 on the validation set.

Model: Logistic Regression
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, one-hot encoding, scaling
Validation Strategy: 80% training, 20% validation
Performance Metric: Accuracy

Challenges Faced:
- Tuning hyperparameters for better performance.

Acknowledgments:
- Leveraged the scikit-learn library for model training.
- Incorporated ideas from Kaggle forums and kernels.

Note: Future iterations may explore more complex models and ensemble methods.
